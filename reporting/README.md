# Reporting (Enterprise Agile Reporting Standard)

## Purpose
This guide defines a clear, lightweight, and outcome-focused approach to Agile reporting in enterprise environments. Reporting exists to enable transparency, informed decision-making, and timely intervention—not to create administrative overhead.

## Guiding Principles
- **Outcome over activity**: Report progress toward outcomes, not task completion.
- **Trend-based, not point-in-time**: Emphasize trends and patterns.
- **Actionable**: Every report should drive a decision or conversation.
- **Single source of truth**: Data is pulled directly from delivery tools.
- **Audience-specific**: Tailor reporting depth to the audience.

## Reporting Levels

### 1. Team-Level Reporting (Scrum Team)
**Audience**: Scrum Team, Product Owner  
**Cadence**: Daily / Sprint-level  

**Focus Areas**
- Sprint goal progress
- Flow of work
- Blockers and risks
- Forecast vs commitment

**Core Artifacts**
- Sprint Backlog
- Task board / Kanban board
- Burndown or Burnup chart
- Impediment log

**Key Questions Answered**
- Are we on track to meet the sprint goal?
- What is blocking progress?
- What needs immediate adjustment?

---

### 2. Program-Level Reporting (Multi-Team / ART)
**Audience**: RTEs, Product Management, Engineering Managers  
**Cadence**: Weekly / PI-level  

**Focus Areas**
- Feature progress
- Cross-team dependencies
- Delivery predictability
- Risk and impediment status

**Core Metrics**
- Feature burnup
- Dependency health
- Predictability (planned vs achieved)
- Escaped dependencies

**Key Questions Answered**
- Where are dependencies creating risk?
- Which teams or features need support?
- Are we trending toward PI objectives?

---

### 3. Executive-Level Reporting
**Audience**: Executives, Senior Leadership  
**Cadence**: Monthly / PI checkpoints  

**Focus Areas**
- Outcomes delivered
- Predictability and stability
- Top risks and mitigation
- Investment vs value realization

**Executive Metrics**
- PI Objectives achievement
- Delivery predictability trend
- Cycle time trend
- Key risks with owners

**Key Questions Answered**
- Are we delivering the intended business outcomes?
- Where should leadership intervene?
- Is delivery health improving or degrading?

---

## Standard Metrics Definitions

### Flow Metrics
- **Throughput**: Items completed per time period
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion
- **WIP**: Items currently in progress
- **Flow Efficiency**: Active work time vs wait time

### Predictability Metrics
- **Commitment Reliability**: Planned vs completed
- **PI Predictability**: Business value planned vs achieved
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Trend-based delivery projection

---

## Reporting Anti-Patterns
- Status reports disconnected from delivery tools
- Reporting volume without insight
- Green-only dashboards with hidden risks
- Individual performance reporting
- Using reports for control instead of enablement

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Scrum Master
- Ensure accurate, timely data
- Coach teams on interpreting metrics
- Surface risks early and clearly

### Product Owner / Product Management
- Connect delivery metrics to outcomes
- Validate value realization
- Use reports to adjust priorities

### Leadership
- Use reports to remove systemic impediments
- Ask outcome-oriented questions
- Avoid micro-management through metrics

---

## Tooling Expectations
- Jira / Azure DevOps as system of record
- Automated dashboards preferred
- Manual reporting minimized
- Metrics definitions standardized across teams

---

## Guiding Principle
> Reporting is successful when it enables better decisions, not when it produces more data.
