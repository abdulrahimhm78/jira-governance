# Backlog Readiness (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
Backlog Readiness ensures that work items entering Sprint Planning are sufficiently clear, valuable, and feasible, enabling predictable delivery and minimizing mid-sprint churn.

## Scope
Applies to all Product Backlog Items (PBIs) intended for near-term delivery, including features, stories, enablers, defects, and technical work.

## Ownership
- **Product Owner**: Accountable for business value, prioritization, and clarity.
- **Scrum Team**: Responsible for validating readiness collaboratively.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates readiness discipline and prevents non-ready work from entering the sprint.

## Readiness Criteria
A backlog item is considered *Ready* when **all** of the following are true:

### Value & Intent
- Business value and user impact are clearly articulated.
- Outcome aligns with product goals and sprint objectives.
- Priority is agreed and visible relative to other items.

### Clarity & Acceptance
- Acceptance criteria are explicit, testable, and unambiguous.
- Success conditions are understood by Developers and QA.
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance) are identified where applicable.

### Size & Feasibility
- Item is appropriately sized to complete within one sprint.
- Dependencies are identified and either resolved or planned.
- Technical approach is broadly understood; spikes completed if needed.

### Quality & Testability
- Test approach is defined (unit, integration, automation, UAT).
- Data needs, environments, and tooling constraints are known.
- Edge cases and error handling are considered.

### Readiness Hygiene
- Clear title and description using a standard template.
- Linked designs, mocks, APIs, or reference documents attached.
- Risks, assumptions, and constraints documented.

## Inputs to Readiness
- Regular backlog refinement sessions
- Stakeholder input and feedback
- Architecture and design guidance
- Dependency and risk registers

## Expected Outcomes
- Stable sprint commitments
- Reduced carryover and rework
- Improved flow and predictability
- Higher delivery confidence

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Pulling items with vague acceptance criteria
- Deferring dependency resolution until mid-sprint
- Over-sizing or under-sizing work
- Treating readiness as a checklist without shared understanding

## Governance
- Items not meeting Backlog Readiness **must not** be pulled into Sprint Planning.
- Readiness standards are reviewed quarterly and adapted as teams mature.

## Guiding Principle
**Ready means the team can confidently commit without discovering surprises during the sprint.**
