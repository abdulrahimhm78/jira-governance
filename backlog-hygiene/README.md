# Backlog Hygiene (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
Backlog Hygiene ensures the product backlog remains clear, prioritized, actionable, and aligned to business outcomes so teams can plan and deliver predictably without churn or rework.

## Scope
Applies to all Scrum and flow-based teams operating in enterprise environments, including product, platform, data, and shared services teams.

## Ownership
- **Primary:** Product Owner (Squad Lead)
- **Facilitator:** Scrum Master
- **Contributors:** Development Team, Architecture, QA, UX, Security, Stakeholders (as needed)

---

## Hygiene Principles
- **Outcome-driven:** Every item ties to a measurable business or customer outcome.
- **Ready over perfect:** Items meet DoR before planning; refinement is continuous.
- **Small and testable:** Work is sliced vertically to deliver value each sprint.
- **Transparent:** Dependencies, risks, and assumptions are explicit.
- **Current:** Stale items are regularly challenged, refined, or removed.

---

## Backlog Structure
Each backlog item should include:
- Clear **title** using outcome-oriented language
- **Problem statement** or value hypothesis
- **Acceptance criteria** (testable and unambiguous)
- **Dependencies** and external constraints
- **Size/estimate** appropriate to the team’s cadence
- **Priority** relative to other items
- **Labels/tags** for reporting (e.g., feature, defect, tech debt, risk)

---

## Definition of Ready (DoR) Checklist
An item is considered ready when:
- Business value is clearly articulated
- Acceptance criteria are defined
- Dependencies are identified and manageable
- Test approach is understood
- Item is appropriately sized for a sprint
- Required designs, data, or decisions are available

---

## Refinement Cadence
- **Weekly backlog refinement** (1–2 hours per sprint)
- Maintain **2–3 sprints** of ready backlog
- Continuous micro-refinement during the sprint as needed

---

## Prioritization Guidelines
- Value and risk first, not urgency
- Consider cost of delay, dependencies, and learning value
- Balance feature delivery with defects and technical debt
- Reassess priorities at least once per sprint

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Overloaded backlog with low-value items
- Vague stories without acceptance criteria
- Carrying items for multiple quarters without review
- Treating refinement as optional or last-minute
- Using the backlog as a parking lot

---

## Metrics & Signals
Healthy backlogs typically show:
- High percentage of sprint items meeting DoR
- Low carryover due to clarity issues
- Stable sprint commitments
- Reduced mid-sprint scope changes

---

## Continuous Improvement
- Review backlog health in retrospectives
- Periodically purge or consolidate stale items
- Adjust refinement practices based on delivery outcomes

---

## Guiding Principle
A clean backlog enables focus. If the backlog is unhealthy, execution will be unpredictable.
