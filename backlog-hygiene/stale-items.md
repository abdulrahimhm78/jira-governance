# Stale Backlog Items (Maintenance Standard)

## Purpose
Managing stale backlog items prevents
confusion, waste, and false demand signals.

## What Is Considered Stale
- Items not updated for multiple sprints
- Work with unclear ownership
- Items no longer aligned to priorities

## Good Practices
- Review backlog age regularly
- Archive or remove obsolete items
- Revalidate priority before refinement

## Common Mistakes
- Letting backlog grow unchecked
- Planning from outdated items
- Treating all backlog items as equal
