# Stale Items Management (Backlog Hygiene Standard)

## Purpose
To ensure the product backlog remains relevant, actionable, and aligned to current business priorities by systematically identifying and addressing stale items.

## Definition of a Stale Item
A backlog item is considered **stale** when one or more of the following conditions apply:
- No meaningful update or refinement activity for **60–90 days**
- Business context, priority, or assumptions are no longer valid
- Dependencies remain unresolved with no active mitigation plan
- Item repeatedly rolls over across sprints without progress
- Acceptance criteria are outdated, unclear, or no longer testable

## Risks of Stale Items
- Inflated backlog size and reduced transparency
- False perception of delivery capacity
- Planning inefficiencies and longer refinement cycles
- Team confusion and loss of focus
- Misalignment between business intent and delivery execution

## Ownership
- **Product Owner**: Accountable for backlog relevance and prioritization
- **Scrum Master**: Ensures stale-item review is a routine practice
- **Delivery Team**: Contributes to refinement, estimation, and technical clarity

## Review Cadence
- Conduct a **stale item review at least once per sprint**
- Perform a **quarterly deep backlog hygiene review** for aged items

## Standard Actions for Stale Items
Each stale item must result in one of the following explicit outcomes:
- **Refine**: Update scope, acceptance criteria, and assumptions
- **Reprioritize**: Adjust ordering based on current value
- **Split**: Break into smaller, actionable items
- **Park**: Move to an icebox with a clear revisit trigger
- **Archive**: Remove from the active backlog with documented rationale

## Decision Questions
Use the following to guide action:
- Does this item still deliver measurable business value?
- Is the problem still relevant today?
- Can the team confidently deliver this within a sprint?
- Are dependencies actively owned and tracked?

## Metrics and Signals
- Percentage of backlog items older than 90 days
- Number of stale items carried sprint over sprint
- Ratio of refined vs. archived items per review cycle

## Good Practices
- Tag items with **Last Reviewed Date**
- Limit active backlog to **2–3 sprints worth of ready work**
- Use explicit aging thresholds (30 / 60 / 90 days)
- Treat backlog hygiene as continuous, not a cleanup event

## Anti-Patterns
- Keeping items “just in case”
- Allowing backlog size to grow unchecked
- Treating stale-item cleanup as administrative work
- Archiving without stakeholder visibility

## Guiding Principle
A healthy backlog reflects today’s priorities—not yesterday’s intentions.
