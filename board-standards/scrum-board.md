# Scrum Board Standards (Enterprise)

## Purpose
The Scrum Board is the single source of truth for sprint execution. These standards ensure transparency, flow, accountability, and predictable delivery across enterprise Scrum teams.

---

## Guiding Principles
- The board reflects **reality**, not intent
- Work flows **left to right**, start to finish
- One item = one owner at a time
- Nothing moves without meeting agreed criteria
- If it is not on the board, it does not exist

---

## Required Columns (Minimum Standard)

1. **Backlog**
   - Refined and prioritized items only
   - Meets Definition of Ready (DoR)
   - Owned by Product Owner

2. **Selected for Sprint**
   - Committed sprint backlog
   - Sprint Goal alignment confirmed
   - Capacity validated

3. **In Progress**
   - Actively worked items only
   - WIP limits enforced
   - One owner per item

4. **Code Review / Validation**
   - Peer review in progress
   - Quality gates applied
   - No new work starts here

5. **Testing**
   - Functional, integration, or automated testing
   - Test results visible
   - Defects linked to stories

6. **Done**
   - Meets Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Potentially shippable
   - Accepted by Product Owner

---

## Work-in-Progress (WIP) Standards
- WIP limits are mandatory for **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Testing**
- Default guideline:
  - In Progress: Team size ÷ 2
  - Review + Testing: ≤ In Progress
- WIP breaches trigger immediate discussion in Daily Scrum

---

## Story Movement Rules
- Stories move **only after criteria are met**
- No skipping columns
- No bulk movement without team agreement
- Blocked items must be flagged immediately

---

## Blocked Work Handling
- Blocked items must be visibly tagged or labeled
- Blocker reason must be documented
- Owner responsible for escalation
- Blockers reviewed daily until resolved

---

## Ownership & Accountability
- Every story has:
  - One clear owner
  - Clear acceptance criteria
  - Linked tasks (if applicable)
- Scrum Master ensures board hygiene
- Team owns accuracy and updates

---

## Tasking Standards
- Tasks support stories; stories deliver value
- Tasks are optional but encouraged for complex work
- Tasks must roll up to a single story
- Task-level ownership is allowed; story ownership remains singular

---

## Defect Handling
- Defects are tracked on the same board
- Severity and priority clearly labeled
- Defects linked to affected stories or releases
- Production defects are explicitly flagged

---

## Metrics Enabled by the Board
- Sprint progress vs commitment
- Cycle time
- WIP aging
- Blocker frequency
- Flow efficiency

---

## Common Anti-Patterns (Not Allowed)
- Status-only boards
- Multiple owners per story
- Hidden work outside the board
- Stories stuck without action
- Moving work to Done without meeting DoD

---

## Enforcement
- Board reviewed daily during Daily Scrum
- Scrum Master enforces standards
- Exceptions require explicit team agreement
- Standards apply across all enterprise teams

---

## Definition of Success
- Real-time transparency
- Predictable delivery
- Reduced context switching
- Faster feedback loops
- High trust between team and stakeholders.
