# Kanban Board Standards

## Purpose
Kanban boards provide continuous
visibility into flow-based delivery
and work-in-progress.

## Core Principles
- Visualize all work
- Limit work in progress
- Manage flow explicitly

## Good Practices
- Define clear entry and exit criteria
- Monitor flow efficiency regularly
- Use explicit WIP limits

## Common Mistakes
- Treating Kanban as Scrum without sprints
- Ignoring WIP limits
- Over-customizing workflows
