# Kanban Board Standards (Enterprise Delivery)

These standards define how Kanban boards are structured, used, and governed to ensure transparency, flow efficiency, and predictable delivery across enterprise teams.

---

## Purpose

To provide a consistent, outcome-focused Kanban board structure that enables teams to:
- Visualize work and flow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Identify bottlenecks early
- Improve predictability and cycle time
- Support data-driven decision-making

---

## Board Design Principles

- Visualize all work from intake to completion
- Optimize for flow, not utilization
- Make policies explicit
- Manage work, not people
- Enable continuous improvement through metrics

---

## Standard Board Columns

A standard enterprise Kanban board includes the following columns:

1. **Backlog**
   - Prioritized, approved work items
   - Meets Definition of Ready (DoR)
   - Not yet committed

2. **Ready**
   - Pulled next based on capacity
   - Fully understood and actionable

3. **In Progress**
   - Actively being worked on
   - WIP limits strictly enforced

4. **Review / Validation**
   - Code review, testing, business validation
   - May include sub-states if required

5. **Blocked**
   - Work impeded by external or internal blockers
   - Must include blocker reason and owner

6. **Done**
   - Meets Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Potentially releasable or released

---

## Work Item Standards

Each Kanban item must include:
- Clear title and description
- Business value or outcome
- Acceptance criteria
- Owner
- Class of Service (if applicable)
- Identified dependencies (if any)

---

## WIP Limit Standards

- WIP limits are mandatory for all active columns
- Limits are set based on team capacity and flow data
- Exceeding WIP requires explicit team agreement
- Blocked items still count toward WIP

---

## Flow Policies

- Work is pulled, never pushed
- Items move only when exit criteria are met
- No skipping columns
- Expedite items must be clearly labeled and limited

---

## Classes of Service (Optional)

If used, standard classes include:
- **Standard** – Normal priority work
- **Fixed Date** – Time-critical commitments
- **Expedite** – Emergency, limited to one at a time
- **Intangible** – Improvement or risk-reduction work

Policies for each class must be explicitly defined.

---

## Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics are required:
- Cycle Time
- Throughput
- WIP
- Flow Efficiency
- Aging Work Items

Metrics are used for improvement, not performance evaluation.

---

## Daily Usage Expectations

- Board is reviewed daily
- Focus on flow and blockers, not status
- Blocked items are escalated within 24 hours
- Aging items are explicitly discussed

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Treating Kanban as a task board
- Ignoring WIP limits
- Hiding work outside the board
- Using the board only for reporting
- Allowing blocked work to stagnate

---

## Governance and Continuous Improvement

- Board policies reviewed quarterly
- WIP limits adjusted based on data
- Retrospectives include flow analysis
- Improvements tracked as explicit work items

---

## Guiding Principle

A Kanban board is a decision-making system.  
If the board does not clearly show where work is stuck and why, it is not serving its purpose.
