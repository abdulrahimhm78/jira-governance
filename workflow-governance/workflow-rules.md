# Workflow Rules (Governance Standards)

## Purpose
Workflow rules ensure consistency,
clarity, and flow across Jira projects
while minimizing unnecessary friction.

## Core Rules
- States reflect real work stages
- Transitions are explicit and intentional
- Blocked work is clearly visible

## Good Practices
- Keep workflows simple
- Review workflows periodically
- Align states with delivery reality

## Common Mistakes
- Creating too many workflow states
- Allowing uncontrolled workflow changes
- Using workflows to enforce reporting
