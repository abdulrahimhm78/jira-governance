# Issue Types (Governance Standards)

## Purpose
Clear issue types ensure work is
categorized consistently and reported
accurately across teams.

## Common Issue Types
- Epic: Large bodies of work spanning sprints
- Story: User- or business-focused functionality
- Task: Technical or operational work
- Bug: Defects impacting functionality

## Good Practices
- Use the smallest appropriate issue type
- Avoid overloading stories with task detail
- Keep issue usage consistent across teams

## Common Mistakes
- Creating too many custom issue types
- Using tasks to bypass backlog refinement
- Mixing work types within a single issue
